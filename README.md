# easybuttonpizero

Adds a RaspberryPi Zero W to a Staples Easy Button for a push-to-SMS project.

The idea for this project was to create a simple way for my mom, who suffers from dementia, to request help from my dad. She can't operate a phone or two-way radio anymore so pushing a button is ideal.

The button is attached to a GPIO pin and monitored by a script. Pressing the button triggers an email to be sent to the email-to-SMS service provided by the phone carrier.
